InMemoryDbService is a class/interface provided by the Angular in-memory-web-api library. It's used for simulating a backend server in Angular applications — especially during development and testing.
Create a mock database in memory.
Serve fake HTTP data using Angular's HttpClient
npm install angular-in-memory-web-api --save

export class InMemoryDataService implements InMemoryDbService
You're telling TypeScript:
“This class will follow the rules defined by the InMemoryDbService interface.”
It ensures your class has a method called createDb() that returns mock data.
returns Observable of the database because could have to create it asynchronously.
Configure it in your app module
this.http.get<Hero[]>('/api/heroes');--The InMemoryDataService will respond with the fake data you returned in createDb().

What is genId()?
This is a helper function used in conjunction with Angular’s InMemoryDbService.
It tells Angular how to generate a new ID when adding a new hero using a POST request.
When you add a new hero, Angular's in-memory API needs to assign a new unique id.
By default, it might fail or duplicate IDs if you don’t tell it how.
So genId() helps by generating the next available ID based on the existing data.

You can do that in HttpClientInMemoryWebApiModule.forRoot(...):
HttpClientInMemoryWebApiModule.forRoot(InMemoryDataService, {
apiBase: 'mockapi/'
})

hero service
tap() is used for side effects — it doesn’t change the data, just performs an action.

.pipe(...)
Used to chain operators for side effects and error handling.
It is used to chain and compose multiple operators on an Observable.
Because when you make an HTTP request using Angular’s HttpClient, it returns an Observable — not the data directly.
.pipe() allows you to process the data, log it, transform it, or handle errors before your component receives it.

catchError(...)
This is an RxJS operator used to catch errors in the observable stream (like failed HTTP requests).
When an error happens, it lets you run some logic instead of letting the error crash the app.

you don’t always need to use .pipe() — it’s only used when you want to apply RxJS operators to the observable returned by something like HttpClient.
You use .pipe() when you want to:
Transform the data (map)
Log or trigger side-effects (tap)
Handle errors (catchError)
Delay, filter, debounce, retry, etc.
The catchError operator in RxJS only runs when there is an error in the observable stream. If no error happens, catchError is completely skipped.

httpOptions = {
headers: new HttpHeaders({ 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }),
};
This sets the HTTP headers to tell the backend:
"Hey, I'm sending JSON data!"
This is important for PUT and POST requests so the server can parse the incoming data correctly.

search-This works because the Angular in-memory-web-api allows filtering via /?name=term.

The previous version assigns an array of heroes to the component's heroes property.
The assignment occurs synchronously, as if the server could return heroes instantly
or the browser could freeze the UI while it waited for the server's response.
That won't work when the HeroService is actually making requests of a remote server.
The new version waits for the Observable to emit the array of heroes, which could
happen now or several minutes from now. The subscribe() method passes the emitted
array to the callback, which sets the component's heroes property.
This asynchronous approach works when the HeroService requests heroes from the server.
